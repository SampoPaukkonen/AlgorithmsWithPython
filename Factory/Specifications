Task:
  There are n machines in a factory where each of which can produce a product in a set time.
  Your task is to make m products with the help of the machines.

  What is the smallest possible time for this?

Input:
  The first input line contains two integers n and m: the number of machines and
  the number of products to produce.

  The next input line has n integers a1, a2,...,an: the time it takes for one machine
  to produce a product.

Output:
  Print one integer: Smallest possible time to produce the m products.
